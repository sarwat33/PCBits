## 🔧 Featured Design

### **1) Project: Digitalite -- Reactive to Light and Sound**

This project is built around the **ATTiny85 microcontroller** and includes the following features:
- **Light Sensing Unit**: Uses an LDR to detect changes in ambient light.
- **Sound Sensing Unit**: Equipped with a microphone for sound detection.
- **Battery Unit**: Powered by a compact coin cell.
- **LED Output**: Displays outputs based on sensor input.

### **2) Project: Full wave bridge rectifier -- Converts AC to DC output**

This project is built using a Transfomer having two coils,one secondary and one primary coil and includes the following features:
- Capacitor has been added to clear out the ripples and smoothen the pulsating DC waveform in the output.
- Resistor has been used as a load.
