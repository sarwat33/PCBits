### **1) Project: Full wave bridge rectifier -- Converts AC to DC output**

This project is built using a Transfomer having two coils,one secondary and one primary coil and includes the following features:
- Capacitor has been added to clear out the ripples and smoothen the pulsating DC waveform in the output.
- Resistor has been used as a load.
